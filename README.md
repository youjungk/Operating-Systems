# CMPT 300: Operating Systems

## Project 1: Review Unix Programming Tools and Basics of C Language
__1. String Manipulation Functions__
...String manipulation functions similar to the standard C string functions.
__2. Linked List Operations__
...The linked list data stucture containing number of functions that create and minipulate a linked list.

## Project 2: Shell with History
__1. Simple Shell__
...Simple UNIX shell. The shell accepts user commands and then executes each command in a seperate process. The shell provides the user a prompt at which the next command is entered.

...This project is organized into three parts: (1) creating the child process andexecuting the command in the child, (2) adding some internal commands, and (3)modifying the shell to allow a history feature.

## Project 3: Candy Kids
__1. Candy kids__
...Collection of threads simulating a candy factory with customers.

...Group of threads will model candy facotries which generate candy one at a time and insert the candy into the bounded buffer. Another group of threads will model kids which eat candy one at a time from the bounded buffer.

## Project 4: Sys-Calls
__1. Array Statistics Sys-Call__
...System call that computes some bgasic statistics on an array of data. This first part of the project accesses memory between user and kernal space before accessing other kernal data structures.
__2. Process Ancestor Sys-Call__
...System call which returns information about the current process, plus its ancestors (its parent process, it's grandparent process, and so on)

> Note: All project directories contain Makefiles, and some contain README.md
